  <title>UEH — Universal Exchange Adapters</title>

<body>
  <h1>Universal Exchange Adapters (UEH)</h1>

  <p>
    UEH is survivability-first infrastructure for operating against unstable exchange APIs.
    Not signals. Not financial advice. No-exec by default.
  </p>

  <h2>Story in 7 lines</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>We started by building bots and chasing “wins”.</li>
    <li>Exchange APIs didn’t behave like stable contracts—latency, limits, and silent drift were normal.</li>
    <li>We learned that correct code can still fail when responsibility boundaries are unclear.</li>
    <li>The turning point was naming the boundary: decision → risk_scan, execution gate → exec_gate, orders → worker, exchange differences → adapters.</li>
    <li>UEH stopped being a bot project and became survivability-first infrastructure.</li>
    <li>Public artifacts are proofs (NO-EXEC); private delivery is controlled (constraints + ops), with clear refusal rules.</li>
    <li>The goal is stable operations, clear accountability, and safe delivery boundaries—no profit claims.</li>
  </ol>

    Note: UEH documents focus on boundary design and operational failure modes.
    It does not provide trading signals, strategies, or execution services.
