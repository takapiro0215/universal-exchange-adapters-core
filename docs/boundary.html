  <h1>UEH Boundary</h1>

  <p>
    Universal Exchange Adapters (UEH) is survivability-first infrastructure
    for operating against unstable exchange APIs.
    UEH does not provide trading signals, strategies, or execution services.
  </p>

  <h2>What UEH Is / Is Not</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Infrastructure for exchange connectivity and operational boundaries</li>
    <li>NO-EXEC by default (public artifacts are proof-only)</li>
    <li>Not a trading bot, signal service, or profit-guarantee product</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Non-Negotiable Boundaries</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>No custody of user funds</li>
    <li>No profit or performance guarantees</li>
    <li>No public execution modules</li>
    <li>Clear responsibility separation (decision / execution / exchange)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Delivery Conditions</h2>
  <p>
    Commercial delivery begins only after explicit boundary acknowledgment
    and payment confirmation. Scope, constraints, and refusal rules are fixed
    before any delivery.
  </p>

  <h2>Public Proof (NO-EXEC)</h2>
  <p>
    Public demonstrations and documentation exist only in non-executing form.
    Commercial constraint packs and operational tooling are delivered privately.
  </p>
